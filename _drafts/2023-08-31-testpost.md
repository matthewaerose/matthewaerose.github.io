# What is the Terraform Console?
The Terraform Console provides a local environment to interrogate state and prove out methods to interact with that state during the plan and apply phases.

## Why is it useful? What problems does it solve?
There are three phases to writing Terraform: development, plan, apply.
The plan and apply phase are Terraform interacting with the state file, whether in a speculative or perfromative manner.
The development phase, however, is entirely under our (developers) control.
One of the frustrating issues with moving from the development to the plan phase is correcting errors with our own code or how interactions occur between previously declared cloud resources.
The Terraform Console can help alleviate these issues!

Let's check it out!
