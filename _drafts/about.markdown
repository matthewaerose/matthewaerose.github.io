Software Engineer! Started in DoD and moved to private SaaS.

My bread and butter is creating elegant solutions, debugging gnarly problems, and being able to talk about why it is important. 

But it didn't start this way!

In 6th grade, I won the award "most likely to work with computers" because of how much time I spent working on and with them. 

Computers and software have always been an underlying theme in my life.

Through high school, I was interested in Ubutntu and Linux, was interested in programming, created cool videos with my friends and used editing software to make them cooler ðŸ˜Ž

But for some reason, I chose to continue to pursue my hobby as piano player into college, instead of computers and software!

I affectionately call my time pursuing and receiving my first degree as "college the first". Out of high school, I went to a liberal arts university and majored in music. My focus was piano performance.

I'll have to dig up some of my performance videos. I don't remember the whole lineup but I concluded my Senior Recital with Scherzo No. 3 by Chopin.

While at "college the first", I was really big into accompaniment. That is where you play the piano with _others_, not just by yourself. 

I accompanied choir, other instruments, and musical theatre. This last one was one I really enjoyed and what I ultimately pursued after I graduated.

Upon graduation, I moved to New York and did a stint at the MacHaydn Theatre company as the Associate Music Director.

I attempted to work more in the field but ultimately came to the conclusion that money was, in fact, important.

So I started working odd jobs around my home town.

And that is where I met my future wife!

Meeting her made me realize I _really_ had to figure out what I was doing. 

So I enrolled at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. I didn't know what I wanted to do but it had to be something with computers. My first degree gave me a big leg up in transferring credits but I still had a long way to go.

I first majored in Computer Engineering, which was distinct from Computer Science. Not knowing the difference between the two, I worked in CE for awhile before realizing, "I don't want to build computers. I want to build the things that run _on_ computers!".

I switched my degree to Computer Science.

While pursuing this degree, I met my first employer through the part-time fast food job I had, and landed an internship.

There I built up a knack for figuring things out on the fly, adapting to rapidly changing situations and requirements, and learning things I didn't know yesterday.

I graduated a few years later and moved to a full-time role at another company.

There I learned how to work on a small team, testing, web development, and my first intro to this thing called "devOps".

From there I moved to a ginormous team. I learned how to cut through the noise and find the things that would have the biggest impact. I learned how to work in a mostly closed system and utilize the tools that I was provided. And how to sell the product that I was developing. Here my devOps muscle was strengthened.

> aside, if you want to learn patience and determination, work in an air-gapped environment.

I moved again to a different team in the same company but this time we had access to a more modern tech stack. 

Here I learned about Docker, ELK stack, kubernetes, micro services, and more devOps tools!

It was about this time that COVID-19 was "ending" and companies wanted to return to the office. 

So I moved again! No more DoD work though. I moved to a private SaaS company. Everything was in the cloud and I was still on the ground. 

Very quickly I ramp up on their tech stack and learn this thing called "Terraform".
